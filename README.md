# MDB Socials
MDB Socials is a social media application allowing members to post and RSVP to social events. MDB Socials uses Firebase Authentication, Realtime Database, and Storage to authenticate users, save social and user information, and store images. Users have the ability to view a global network of social events stored in the database. As a feature, they will never be able to delete these events or un-RSVP from events.
